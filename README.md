# VisualScript module for Godot 4.0

## Compiling

* ```cd``` into the root folder of Godot's source code
* ```git clone https://github.com/Higgs1/godot-visual-script.git modules/visual_script```
* compile Godot with ```scons``` as per usual. Their build script is configured to automatically include new modules. 

[See the Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/)
for instructions on how to compile the engine.
